# CalculatorApp

## Where to find the actual code
I put this in case any of you are just looking to see a sample of the code I've written and aren't familiar with android.

The main java file I wrote for this project is in:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CalculatorApp/app/src/main/java/com/example/user/calculatorapp/MainActivity.java
  
As you can see it kind of buried and hard to find : )


## Synopsis
This is just a simple calculator that also does exponents and squareroots. 
It was written with Android Studio so it contains mostly Java and XML.
